# ISSUES
1. Not thoroughly tested -- errors can occur during normal usage
 - need comprehensive test workflows (how would a user interact with the application?)
 2. Lacking usability -- think about having hundreds of company reports stored -- selecting companies might become diffcult.
    - lack of notification when program is loading -- add loading indicators (library tqdm)
    - make selecting what report to ask questions on easier (i.e., selection instead of typing in the company name and year...)

3. Add additional commands for handling temporary reports (not saving them to the ./content/companies directory). User might just want questions on the one report
4. Add intra and inter company question handling using the fusion framework.


5. Allow user to choose different retrievers
