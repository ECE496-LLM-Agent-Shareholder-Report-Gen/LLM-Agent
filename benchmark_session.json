Global economic and market uncertainty may adversely impact our business and operating results. The semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has experienced severe downturns that have materially adversely affected, and may continue to materially adversely affect, our business in the future. The demand for our products depends in part on the market conditions in the industries which they are sold. Fluctuations in demand for our products or a market decline in any of these industries could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. The loss of a significant customer may have a material adverse effect on us. The ongoing novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The markets in which our products are sold are highly competitive. Our operating results are subject to quarterly and seasonal sales patterns.If we cannot adequately protect our technology or other intellectual property in the United States and abroad, through patents, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks and other measures, we may lose a competitive advantage and incur significant expenses. Unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect usOperational and Technology Risks We rely on third parties to manufacture our products, and if they are unable to do so on a timely basis in sufficient quantities and using competitive technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected.If essential equipment, materials, substrates or manufacturing processes are not available to manufacture our products, we could be materially adversely affected.Failure to achieve expected manufacturing yields for our products could negatively impact our financial results.The success of our business is dependent upon our ability to introduce products on a timely basis with features and performance levels that provide value to our customers while supporting and coinciding with significant industry transitions.Our revenue from our semi-custom System-on-Chip (SoC) products is dependent upon our semi-custom SoC products being incorporated into customers' products and the success of those products.Our products may be subject to security vulnerabilities that could have a material adverse effect on us. IT outages, data loss, data breaches and cyber-attacks could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, be costly to remediate or cause significant damage to our business, reputation and operations.We may encounter difficulties in upgrading and operating our new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, which could materially adversely affect us. Uncertainties involving the ordering and shipment of our products could materially adversely affect us. Our ability to design and introduce new products in a timely manner includes the use of third-party intellectual property.We depend on third-party companies for the design, manufacture and supply of motherboards, software, memory and other computer platform components to support our business and products.If we lose Microsoft Corporation's support for our products or other software vendors do not design and develop software to run on our products, our ability to sell our products could be materially adversely affected (page 14)Our reliance on third-party distributors and add-in-board (AIB) partners subjects us to certain risks. Our business is dependent upon the proper functioning of our internal business processes and information systems and modification or interruption of such systems may disrupt our business, processes and internal controls. If our products are not compatible with some or all industry-standard software and hardware, we could be materially adversely affected. Costs related to defective products could have a material adverse effect on us. If we fail to maintain the efficiency of our supply chain as we respond to changes in customer demand for our products, our business could be materially adversely affected. We outsource to third parties certain supply-chain logistics functions, including portions of our product distribution, transportation management and information technology support services.Our inability to effectively control the sales of our products on the gray market could have a material adverse effect on us. (Page 15)Legal and Regulatory RisksGovernment actions and regulations such as export regulations, tariffs, and trade protection measures may limit our ability to export our products to certain customers. If we cannot realize our deferred tax assets, our results of operations could be adversely affected. Our business is subject to potential tax liabilities, including as a result of tax regulation changes. We are party to litigation and may become a party to other claims or litigation that could cause us to incur substantial costs or pay substantial damages or prohibit us from selling our products. We are subject to environmental laws, conflict minerals-related provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act as well as a variety of other laws or regulations that could result in additional costs and liabilities.
